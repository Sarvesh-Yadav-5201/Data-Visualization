# <b> Jobhopper Analysis</b>
__________________________________
## <b> DESCRIPTION :
> This project aims to analyze the jobhopper data to gain insights into the behavior and characteristics of jobhoppers. The dataset used for this project contains information about jobhoppers such as their demographics, education level, experience, and current job details.

## <b> Project Outline:   
  > * Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and dropping irrelevant columns.
  > * Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing the data to gain insights about jobhoppers.
  > * Multivariate Analysis: Analyzing the relationships between different variables.
  > * Conclusion: Summarizing the findings and drawing conclusions.
  
  
## <b> Technologies Used:
  
> * Python 3.7  
> * Jupyter Notebook 
> * Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn libraries
  
  
## <b> Getting Started:
  
> *Clone the repository.
> *Install the required libraries.
> *Run the Jupyter Notebook.
  
## <b>Dataset:
  
> The dataset used for this project is provided by Kaggle. It contains 19,158 records and 14 columns.
  
## <b> RESULTS: 
  
  > The analysis reveals that male candidates are more likely to change jobs than candidates of other genders. The distribution of relevant experience among job hoppers shows that 75% of candidates have relevant experience while only 25% do not. The highest mean city development index was found in City 98. The distribution of last new job shows that the majority of job hoppers have been in their current job for less than 3 years.

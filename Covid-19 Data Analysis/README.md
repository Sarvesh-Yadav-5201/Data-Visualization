________________________

## Description:
>This project analyzes two datasets related to COVID-19 in India: one containing information about COVID-19 cases for every state in India, and the other containing information about COVID-19 vaccination in India, broken down by state. The project aims to gain insights into the COVID-19 situation and vaccination progress in India by analyzing the datasets and visualizing the results using various chart types.

## Project outline:
>The project consists of the following steps:

>* Data preprocessing and cleaning for both datasets
>* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for both datasets
>* Visualization of the results using various chart types

## Technology used:
> The project was implemented using Python 3.8. 
> The following libraries were used:

  >* Pandas
  >* Matplotlib
  >* Plotly
  
## How to use the project file:

>* Clone this repository to your local machine.
>* Open the file Covid_data-analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible IDE.
>* Run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the results.

## Results:
> The project provides insights into the COVID-19 situation and vaccination progress in India. Some of the key findings are:

>* Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka are the states with the most active COVID-19 cases.
>* The recovery rate is highest in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Assam, while the mortality rate is highest in Punjab, Maharashtra, and Delhi.
